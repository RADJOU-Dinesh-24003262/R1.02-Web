00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.519
We are going to make together a veal escalope stuffed with slices of breaded kebab crispy.

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.359
A nice veal escalope, a little bit of crispy batter,

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:19.799
then we will add the slices of kebab.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.120
And here's the secret: we are going to fold the escalope, press it down well,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.279
we'll wrap the escalope well in the batter, and turn it onto the crispy side.

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:48.360
A little bit, we have our petals, now let's move on to cooking, it needs to be really hot.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:01:00.210
We will let it cook for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
